## What is this, anyway?

Composure was inspired by [this very enlightening / funny talk][talk] by Gary
Bernhardt.

What it basically does is allow you to turn shell script one-liners into
composable, maintainable mini-utilities that you can pipe together on the
command line.

Composure's [README][] is excellent, with examples and even a short screencast
showing sample usage.

The scripts in this repository are small commands intended to be used to
develop, test, and maintain the [PhyloWeb][] project.
